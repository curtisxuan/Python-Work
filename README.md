# Python-Work

Updating Cookies For Scraping Weibo: Accounts are required to scrape information from Weibo (Chinese Twitter), so I made a python program that regulates the 1000 accounts saved in Redis by updating their cookies if they haven't been updated in the last 3 days.

Facebook Scraping: Scraped all my facebook contacts and their facebook contacts as well (in Fb_Friends.txt) in order to analyze my friend groups. (Can view in Rplot.png)

Autobot: Using chrome and selenium driver to automate logging in process and hunting. Also clears captcha by screenshotting the captcha, sending the screenshot to a captcha recognition service, and submitting the received code.
